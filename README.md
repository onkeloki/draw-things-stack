# Draw Things Stack

## Overview
This is a Draw Things Stack processing script written in Node.js.

This script reads prompts from a file (**_input/prompts.txt**), sends them to an API to generate images, and saves the images to an **_output** directory. It also marks prompts as [DONE] once they have been processed.

Make sure that you have draw things running and api enabled on port 7860
